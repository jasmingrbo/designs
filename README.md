# Designs
- A collection of designs implemented using Android's new UI toolkit Jetpack Compose.
- Improvisations were sometimes necessary and therefore made.
- The code is not "production" ready as
  the UI is done rather very quickly, in a prototype manner so to say.
- Projects are done with different level of Compose knowledge I had at the time of writing them.
